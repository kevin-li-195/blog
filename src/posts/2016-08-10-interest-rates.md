title: What are interest rates?

##### Finance

Work in progress:

What this means is that when you take out a loan (i.e. borrowing money) from The Bank of Money, that loan will
have some terms on it. There are lots of terms that we don't need to talk about right now (but I felt it was
important to mention because the interest rate shouldn't be the only factor you consider when taking out
a loan!), but you'll have an interest rate on that loan (expressed as an APR, or Effective Annual Rate, or some other
equally jargon-y term. We won't talk about the differences between how interest rates are expressed here since
it's not that important for now. Perhaps that interest rate blog post is worth writing after all.).

Conversely, when you put money in The Bank of Money
(i.e. lending money. [Because you *are* lending money to them!](www.kevinl.io/blog/posts/placeholder)),
you earn an interest rate.
