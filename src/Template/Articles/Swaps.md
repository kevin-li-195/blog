## What are **swaps**?
### Finance => Derivatives

A good friend asked a good question the other day:

> <GoodFriend> What are [swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_(finance))?

Good question. Before talking about swaps, I'd like to preface this post by mentioning
that Wikipedia, Investopedia, and other resources online/at your local library can certainly provide a more detailed,
technical, and accurate explanation than I ever could; however, if what you want is to just know what a swap **is**,
without having to touch any weird financial jargon (while picking some up along the way!)
then you've come to the right place! We'll answer this question at a high level by using three common examples of swaps:

1. [Interest rate swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_swap) (IRS)
2. [Currency swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_swap) (not to be confused with [foreign exchange swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_swap)
which are a very different kind of swap)
3. [Credit default swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap) (CDS)

First, a nice, general, informal definition of a swap: 

> A swap is an agreement (a contract, if you will) between two parties to exchange 
> certain amounts of certain things at certain times in a certain period.

This definition doesn't really help us though. To understand better what a swap is, it's
necessary to know *why* somebody would want to enter into such an agreement.

> Typically, a party will want to enter a swap agreement 
> in order to shield themselves from certain risks
> (also known as hedging).

Okay, that's a bit better, but still a bit too general and abstract. What are the certain risks that
we would like to protect ourselves against?
